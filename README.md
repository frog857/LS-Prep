Coding Exercises for Zack Brashear Launch School

A place to examine code for all exercises in organized folders. Folders/subfolders divided into unit, section, and topic. Meant to be easy to find all exercises, and also for practice using git and github.

So far these exercises are quite simple, so topic exercises are all in one file. In the future, exercises may have individual files stored in a topic subfolder.
